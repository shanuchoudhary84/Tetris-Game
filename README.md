# Tetris Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Introduction

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. In this project, we recreate the essence of Tetris using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay: Drop tetrominoes (shapes composed of four square blocks) into a grid and clear lines to score points.
- Simple controls: Use arrow keys to move and rotate tetrominoes, and space bar to drop them instantly.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of lines cleared.
- Game over detection: End the game when tetrominoes stack up to the top of the grid.

## Setup

To run this game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can use a development server to serve the files.

## Usage

Once the game is loaded in your web browser, use the following controls to play:

- **  A  **: Move the falling tetromino left.
- **  D  **: Move the falling tetromino right.
- **  S  **: Move the falling tetromino down (faster descent).
- **  **: Rotate the falling tetromino clockwise.
- **Space Bar**: Instantly drop the falling tetromino to the bottom.

The objective of the game is to clear as many lines as possible by filling horizontal lines with tetrominoes. Each cleared line scores points, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the grid.
